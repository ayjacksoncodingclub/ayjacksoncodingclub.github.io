# A.Y. Jackson Coding Club Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Coding Club! You can find us at https://ayjcoding.club - see you there!

## Technical details
The theme used on this Jekyll site is a significantly modified version of [Yet Another Theme](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat) called AYTheme. It may be published to its own repository in the future.

AYJCodingClubBot, used to quickly create blog posts by lecturers, is custom-written. The source code for the bot portion will be released in the future.
